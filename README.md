Learning HTML - My Journey
Introduction
Welcome to my HTML learning journey! This repository is dedicated to tracking my progress as I dive into the basics of HTML (HyperText Markup Language). HTML is the standard markup language used to create web pages, and it's the foundation of web development.

What is HTML?
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to structure content on the web, allowing you to create paragraphs, headings, links, images, and more. HTML uses a system of tags to define elements within a webpage.

Why Learn HTML?
Understanding HTML is crucial for anyone interested in web development. It forms the backbone of all web pages, and learning it will give you the ability to create your own websites, understand how web pages are built, and customize web content to suit your needs.

Goals
